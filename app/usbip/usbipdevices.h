/**
 * USB/IP input passthrough — exporter side (the machine the devices are plugged into).
 *
 * Terminology is locked; read docs/usb-ip-input-passthrough.md before touching this.
 * This class never says host / client / server: in USB/IP the "host" is the DEVICE side,
 * and in streaming the host is the machine serving the VIDEO. On our two machines those
 * are opposite PCs, so the bare words invert the design. Use exporter / importer.
 *
 * This is the model behind the Input settings tab. It answers two questions and nothing
 * else:
 *   - which USB devices are plugged into THIS machine, and is each one already offered
 *     to an importer;
 *   - which of them has the user asked to offer.
 *
 * It does NOT bind. Binding is a privileged operation (verified 2026-10-03: `attach` runs
 * fine as a normal user, `bind` is refused), so it belongs to the input service that ships
 * in ArtMoon's own installer. This class asks that service to reconcile, and reports
 * honestly when the service is not there.
